# Open-Source Software Development DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Stacks blockchain for funding and managing open-source software development projects. The platform enables developers to submit proposals, token holders to vote on funding decisions, and manages project milestones through smart contracts.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Decentralized Proposal System**: Submit and manage development proposals
- **Token-Based Governance**: Democratic decision-making through governance tokens
- **Milestone-Based Funding**: Automated release of funds based on project milestones
- **Treasury Management**: Secure handling of DAO funds
- **Transparent Voting**: On-chain voting system with token-weighted decisions

### Key Benefits
- Transparent funding allocation
- Community-driven project selection
- Secure milestone-based payments
- Decentralized governance
- Automated contract execution

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- Written in Clarity (Stacks blockchain)
- Core components:
    - Governance token management
    - Proposal system
    - Voting mechanism
    - Treasury management
    - Milestone tracking

### Testing Framework
- Built with Vitest
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests for contract interactions

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js (v14 or higher)
# Install Stacks CLI
npm install -g @stacks/cli

# Install project dependencies
npm install
```

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opensource-dao.git
cd opensource-dao

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local Stacks blockchain
stacks-node start

# Deploy contracts (local)
npm run deploy:local
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
NETWORK=testnet
DEPLOYER_KEY=your_private_key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
```

## 📘 Smart Contract Documentation

### Governance Token Functions
```clarity
(mint-governance-tokens (amount uint) (recipient principal))
(get-token-balance (holder principal))
```

### Proposal Management
```clarity
(submit-proposal 
    (title (string-ascii 50))
    (description (string-ascii 500))
    (amount uint)
    (milestones (list 5 (string-ascii 100)))
    (milestone-amounts (list 5 uint)))

(get-proposal (proposal-id uint))
```

### Voting System
```clarity
(vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint) (vote bool))
(get-vote (proposal-id uint) (voter principal))
```

### Treasury Management
```clarity
(fund-treasury)
(complete-milestone (proposal-id uint) (milestone-index uint))
(get-treasury-balance)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- dao.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Test Coverage Areas
- Governance token operations
- Proposal submission and management
- Voting system
- Milestone completion
- Treasury management
- Error handling

## 🚀 Deployment

### Testnet Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### Mainnet Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Verify contract deployment
2. Initialize governance tokens
3. Fund treasury
4. Set up initial governance parameters
